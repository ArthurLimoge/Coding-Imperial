This repository contains various algorithms I have had the opportunity to code (in Python). Most of them were done for the course *Introduction to Numerical Analysis* by [Peter Schmid](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/peter.schmid) :

• Householder_QR_Reduction: to factorize an arbitrary matrix as a product of an orthogonal and an upper triangular ones.
• Parallel_QR_Reduction: algorithm which consists in subdivising big matrices into smaller blocks, to optimize QR decomposition, as specified in [this article](https://web.stanford.edu/group/ctr/Summer/SP14/08_Transition_and_turbulence/08_sayadi.pdf). The algorithm is based on the sketch page 2.
